Updates from HW2:
- removed decrement thread - threads are now globally unique once declared - ids no longer reused
    - does 128 MAX threads mean concurrent running threads or total declared threads?   RUNNING threads
- OF COURSE - I HAD TO MOVE THE STACK POINTER BACK DOWN TO WHERE IT WAS ALLOCATED TO FREE IT
